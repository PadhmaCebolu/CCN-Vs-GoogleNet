# CCN-Vs-GoogleNet
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to compare the performance of two deep learning models, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and GoogleNet, on a specific dataset. The notebook provides an end-to-end implementation, from data preparation to model evaluation, allowing users to understand the performance trade-offs between these architectures.

## Features

Data Preparation: Preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for training and evaluation.

Model Implementation: Implementation of CNN and GoogleNet architectures.

Training: Training both models with appropriate hyperparameters.

Evaluation: Performance metrics and comparisons.

Visualization: Graphical representations of training progress and results.
